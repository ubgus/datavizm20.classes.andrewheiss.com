<p>Like yesterday, there isn’t really a lesson today. You’re not learning how to use any new functions—you’re learning how to apply the geoms you already know in cool and exciting ways. But don’t worry! You’ll have a lesson for session 9!</p>
<p>For the lesson, <a href="/example/08-example/">read through the code examples in the example</a> to see how to make small multiples, sparklines, geofacets, and slopegraphs.</p>
